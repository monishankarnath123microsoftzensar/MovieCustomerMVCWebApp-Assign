1.Explore Yield Keywords
Ans: The yield keyword signals to the compiler that the method in which it appears is an iterator block. 
 The compiler generates a class to implement the behavior that is expressed in the iterator block. In the iterator block, 
 the yield keyword is used together with the return keyword to provide a value to the enumerator object. 
 This is the value that is returned, for example, in each loop of a foreach statement. 
 The yield keyword is also used with break to signal the end of iteration."
